# algolia-alexa-state-capitals
Algolia powered Alexa skill to teach you and quiz you on US State capitals

**Note:** I am attempting to create this project using ["README Driven Development"](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html) as noted by [Dustin Coates](https://twitter.com/dcoates?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), and, in turn, recommended to him, by [Vincent Voyer](https://twitter.com/vvoyer) in the post ["Perspectives on Building the Algolia Alexa Adapter"](https://www.talkingtocomputers.com/building-algolia-search-alexa-adapter).

# Create the Algolia Index

1. Login to your Algolia account or Sign-up for an account [here](https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up) if you don't have one already (Note: You can get a free [Community](https://www.algolia.com/pricing/) plan)
2. Copy the `.env.schema` file and name it `.env` for your configuration variables 
3. Navigate to the "API Keys" tab in your Algolia Dashboard to find the Application ID and Admin API Key, then in your `.env` file set the following values:
```
APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
ADMIN_API_KEY=YOUR_ADMIN_API_KEY
INDEX_NAME=YOUR_INDEX_NAME_OF_YOUR_CHOICE
``` 
4. Install the node modules:
```
yarn
```
5. The file `upload.js` has a script that will push the data from `state-capitals.json` into an Algolia index. Run the script with:
```
yarn upload
```
If interested, you can read more about the [Algolia Javascript API Client](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-client/getting-started/install/javascript/), [indexing](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-client/methods/indexing/), and [settings](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-client/methods/settings/) for search relevance.

6. Navigate to "Indices" in your Algolia Dashboard and select your index from the dropdown. You should see records with a data structure matching the objects in `state-capitals.json`

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You've indexed with Algolia
